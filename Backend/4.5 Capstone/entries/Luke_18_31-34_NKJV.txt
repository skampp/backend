Luke 18:31-34 NKJV
[Luke 18:31-34 NKJV] 31 Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished. 32 "For He will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon. 33 "They will scourge [Him] and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again." 34 But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.

Observation:
Jesus is revealing His fulfilling of the prophecies - the horrible and Good News of the gospel message.

Interpretation:
Up to this point, Jesus has preached and taught about the kingdom.  At this point, no one can truly understand the full message.  Here, He explains what will happen to Him as He becomes the perfect sacrifice for our sin.  

Exactly what they thought of this, I don't know - but it was sure to have been filed away in their minds as one more thing to try and make sense of.  The purpose of this interaction was for the future - for me now and for them later.

Application:
Salvation is sort of two-fold in one respect.  Jesus made the ultimate sacrifice for me, but that doesn't automatically put me into the kingdom.  I've got to have faith in all that He said prior to His death, burial, and resurrection.  Then the sacrifice becomes for me.  There is nothing that I can add to that.  Full stop?
